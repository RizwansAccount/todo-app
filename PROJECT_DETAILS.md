in this project I used many libraries like
=> express to create server and make Restful Apis
=> mongoose to connect with database and perform crud operations with database
=> dotenv to lead variables of env file
=> cors to enable API access from the browser, as cross-origin requests are restricted by default

=> I followed the structure of your express-boilerplate to keep the code clean.
=> I also created a constants folder for HTTP responses to standardize the responses sent to requests.
